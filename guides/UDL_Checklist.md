# UDL & Accessibility Checklist — HPC Bootcamp

This checklist helps ensure materials, labs, and assessments are accessible to all learners and follow Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles.

---

## Visual Accessibility
- [ ] Use **high-contrast, color-blind-safe** palettes in plots (avoid red/green conflicts).  
- [ ] Provide **alt text** for every figure, diagram, or screenshot.  
- [ ] Ensure **monospaced font** for code; avoid font sizes <12pt.  
- [ ] Break long code lines at 80–100 chars for readability.  
- [ ] Use shapes/patterns (dashed vs solid lines) in addition to colors for plots.  

## Multiple Means of Representation (UDL)
- [ ] Provide key content in at least **two formats** (text + diagram, text + worked example).  
- [ ] Include **step-by-step examples** before faded exercises.  
- [ ] Offer **advance organizers** (Day intro slide = overview of goals).  
- [ ] Maintain consistent “What / Why / Apply / Deliverables” rhythm.  

## Engagement & Flexibility
- [ ] Highlight **must-do vs optional** tasks so students can pace/stretch.  
- [ ] Use **hinge questions** and polls for quick engagement checks.  
- [ ] Rotate **team roles** daily (Driver, Navigator, Recorder, Presenter).  
- [ ] Provide both **stretch goals** (MPI, GPU capsule) and **core must-dos**.  

## Action & Expression
- [ ] Ensure students can **submit artifacts in Markdown/CSV/plots**, not PDF-only.  
- [ ] Provide **CSV templates** for plotting to reduce busywork.  
- [ ] Allow **keyboard-only navigation** for slide exports / web materials.  
- [ ] Caption demo videos (if used) and provide transcripts.  

## Instructor Delivery
- [ ] Start each day with **3 learning outcomes** on screen.  
- [ ] End each day with an **exit ticket** (reflection or hinge Q).  
- [ ] Summarize “patterns we saw today” to reinforce common lessons.  
- [ ] Use **think-pair-share** for 2-minute discussions after key concepts.
