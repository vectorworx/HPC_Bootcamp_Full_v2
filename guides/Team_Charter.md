# Team Charter Template — HPC Bootcamp

Each team must complete this charter by the end of Day 0. It clarifies roles, expectations, and processes for the week.

---

## Team Name
- [Enter a short, creative team name]

## Members
- [List names + GitHub handles or initials]

---

## Roles
Each day, rotate the following roles (recommended order is provided, but teams may adapt):

- **Driver**: Types code, executes commands.  
- **Navigator**: Reviews Driver’s work, spots bugs, keeps big picture in mind.  
- **Recorder**: Maintains lab log (`reports/dayX/`), ensures reproducibility details are captured.  
- **Presenter**: Prepares and delivers daily stand-up and final defense.  

**Rotation Schedule (example):**
| Day | Driver | Navigator | Recorder | Presenter |
|-----|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 0   |        |           |          |           |
| 1   |        |           |          |           |
| 2   |        |           |          |           |
| 3   |        |           |          |           |
| 4   |        |           |          |           |
| 5   |        |           |          |           |

## Decision-Making
- Primary method (circle one): **Consensus / Majority Vote / Lead Decider**  
- Escalation process: [Define what happens if deadlock]

---

## Conflict Resolution
- Step 1: Direct conversation between involved members.  
- Step 2: Team discussion with mediator (Navigator or Presenter).  
- Step 3: Instructor/TA involvement if unresolved.

---

## Communication Norms
- Daily stand-up = 3 minutes per team (yesterday, today, blocker).  
- Use concise commit messages in repo (`reports/dayX/` + code).  
- Preferred chat channel or in-person notes: [Specify].  

---

## Commitment
We agree to:  
1. Rotate roles fairly.  
2. Document work reproducibly.  
3. Raise blockers early.  
4. Respect time boxes and deadlines.
