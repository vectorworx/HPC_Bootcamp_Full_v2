# Day 0 — Learning Outcomes (Bloom-Aligned)

This sheet makes Day 0 objectives explicit and measurable. Include it in your Day 0 handouts or pin it in your repo.

---

## Outcomes (Students will be able to…)

1) **Define** the HPC performance mindset and reproducibility contract *(Remember/Understand)*  
- **Mastery evidence:** Accurately restates the 4-step loop (measure → analyze → change → validate) and lists at least 4 reproducibility items (commands, flags, env, hardware).

2) **Identify** required tools and verify the environment using sanity scripts *(Understand/Apply)*  
- **Mastery evidence:** Runs all three sanity scripts; attaches logs; explains any warnings.

3) **Classify** team roles and establish a Team Charter *(Understand/Apply)*  
- **Mastery evidence:** Team submits a 1-page charter with roles (Driver, Navigator, Recorder, Presenter), rotation schedule, decision rule, and conflict plan.

4) **Organize** a lab log template for the week *(Apply)*  
- **Mastery evidence:** Creates a lab log (Markdown) with sections for commands, environment, results, and lessons learned; linked in repo `reports/` folder.

---

## Quick Checks (Formative)
- **1-minute poll:** “What is the *first* step before you change code?”  
- **Hinge question:** Which of these affects reproducibility? A) Random seed  B) Loop unrolling  C) Compiler  D) **All of the above** → Correct: D

---

## Exit Ticket (Day 0)
- List one risk if you skip reproducibility documentation, and one step you’ll add to your personal workflow.

---

## Artifacts to Collect
- Sanity script logs; Team Charter; lab log template link in `reports/`.
