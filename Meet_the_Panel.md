# Meet the Panel

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note  
The panels described here are **virtual expert panels** created for the design and review of this HPC Bootcamp.  
Each panelist is a **persona based on a real-world expert‚Äôs published expertise, research, and professional contributions**.  

These individuals did **not personally consult or review** this course.  
Instead, their known body of work and thought leadership were synthesized to simulate the perspectives they might bring to a curriculum like this.  

Two panels were created:  
1. **HPC Expert Panel** ‚Äî virtual personas based on world-class performance computing leaders.  
2. **Instructional Design & Education Panel** ‚Äî virtual personas based on leading education theorists and CS education researchers.

## üåü How They Shaped the Course

These **virtual expert panels** were used as a design tool to simulate rigorous, multi-perspective review.  
They brought balance between:  

- **HPC rigor**: ensuring technical accuracy, reproducibility, and performance alignment.  
- **Instructional design strength**: ensuring accessibility, engagement, and measurable learning outcomes.  

Together, they helped shape a bootcamp that is:  
- **Technically rigorous** enough for national security HPC contexts.  
- **Instructionally sound** for adult learners entering HPC for the first time.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: These panels are **personas modeled on real-world experts**.  
They represent **informed simulations**, not personal endorsements or direct participation.
