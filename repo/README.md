# Repo — Student Workspace

This directory contains the **code and reports** students work with during the bootcamp.

## Layout
- `src/` — Baseline C programs (matmul, sort, nqueens). Start here on Day 1.
- `solution_keys/` — Instructor reference implementations (do not share with students during graded work).
- `extras/` — Optional experiments (STREAM-like bandwidth, MPI mini-lab).
- `reports/` — Your daily outputs (tables, plots, notes) and final portfolio.

## Getting Started
```bash
cd repo/src
make -j        # if Makefile present, otherwise build individual files
# or run course scripts (if provided)
```

## Reporting
- Save artifacts per day under `reports/dayX/`.
- Final portfolio goes in `reports/final/`.
