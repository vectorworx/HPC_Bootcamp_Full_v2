# HPC Bootcamp — Day 5: Scaling & Capstone Defense

---

### Objectives
- Perform scaling experiments
- Explore MPI collectives (Allreduce)
- Assemble final portfolio
- Present capstone defense

---

### Step 1: Strong Scaling
- Fix workload size
- Increase threads (1 → N)
- Measure runtime, compute speedup, efficiency

---

### Step 2: Weak Scaling
- Increase workload proportional to threads
- Goal: runtime remains ~constant
- Plot weak scaling curve

---

### Step 3: MPI Allreduce (Optional Lab)
- Run provided example with 2–8 ranks
- Compare parallel vs serial reduction
- Record scaling and communication cost

---

### Step 4: Assemble Final Portfolio
- Collect results from Days 1–4
- Include scaling plots
- Summarize lessons learned
- Verify reproducibility appendix

---

### Step 5: Capstone Defense
- Teams present:
  - Baseline → optimized results
  - Key optimizations applied
  - Lessons and surprises
  - Future work
- Use the Portfolio as a visual aid

---

### End of Day-5 Goals
- Scaling experiments complete
- Optional MPI lab demonstrated
- Portfolio compiled and submitted
- Capstone defense delivered
