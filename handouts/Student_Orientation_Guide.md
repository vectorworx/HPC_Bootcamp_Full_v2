# Student Orientation Guide — HPC Bootcamp

---

## Welcome
You are joining an intensive one-week bootcamp in High Performance Computing (HPC).  
You already know C. This course will prepare you for **performance engineering**.

---

## Expectations
- **Active participation** — every student contributes.
- **Teamwork** — rotate roles daily (Driver/Navigator/Recorder/Presenter).
- **Evidence-first culture** — show numbers, counters, plots.
- **Reproducibility** — every experiment must be repeatable.

---

## Daily Flow
- Morning: lecture + worked examples.
- Afternoon: labs + team work.
- Evening: reflection + report writing.

---

## What You’ll Learn
- How to measure performance scientifically.
- How to optimize in layers: Algorithm → Layout → SIMD → Threads → Memory/Compiler.
- How to evaluate correctness vs speed tradeoffs.
- How to present results professionally.

---

## End of Bootcamp
- You will produce a **portfolio** showing your optimization journey.
- You will defend your work in a **capstone presentation**.
